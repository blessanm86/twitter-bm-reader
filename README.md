# twitter-bm-reader
Read tweets in your timeline that came after the last one you read. TBMR will continuously save the incoming tweets for you to read later. I was missing many informational tweets just because I didn't get time to check twitter everyday. This is my solution to it.

Follow the below steps to run the app
`git clone `
`npm install`
`npm start`
Go to `http://localhost:3000/`
